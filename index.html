        <h1>What kind of learner are you?</h1>
        <p>We experience the world through all
            our senses. However, you probably
            tend to favor one of them, although
            we resort to the others every now
            and then. Check which kind ofl
            learner you are predominantly.</p>

        <p><strong>Highest score in group 1</strong>: You
            are probably a <i>visual learner</i>.
            Chances are that you prefer taking in
            information through your eyes. You
            probably like to see things written
            down, read books, looks at pictures,
            illustrations, and diagrams. Your notes
            are organized and neat so that you
            can check them in the future.</p>

        <p><strong>Highest score in group 2</strong>: You are
            probably an <i>auditory learner</i>. You
            probably like to get information
            through your ears. You appreciate
            hearing things and listening to audio
            recordings. Chances are that you also
            like to repeat things in your head.
            During classes, you'd probably rather
            listen to the teacher than take notes.</p>

        <p><strong>Highest score in group 3</strong>: You are
            probably a <i>kinesthetic learner</i>.
            You probably like to get information
            through your hands, body or
            emotions. You probably like to
            touch things, and be in movement.
            You also like to take notes, not
            necessarily to look at them again,
            but because the movement of your
            hand across paper helps you keep
            the information you are studying.</p>
