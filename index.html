        <h1>What kind of learner are you?</h1>
        <p>We experience the world through all
our senses. However, you probably
tend to favor one of them, although
we resort to the others every now
and then. Check which kind ofl
learner you are predominantly.</p>
<p><strong>Highest score in group 1</strong>: You
are probably a <i>visual learner</i>.
Chances are that you prefer taking in
information through your eyes. You
probably like to see things written
down, read books, looks at pictures,
illustrations, and diagrams. Your notes
are organized and neat so that you
can check them in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Highest score in group 2</strong>: You are
probably an <i>auditory learner</i>. You
probably like to get information
through your ears. You appreciate
hearing things and listening to audio
recordings. Chances are that you also
like to repeat things in your head.
During classes, you'd probably rather
listen to the teacher than take notes.</p>
<p><strong>Highest score in group 3</strong>: You are
probably a <i>kinesthetic learner</i>.
You probably like to get information
through your hands, body or
emotions. You probably like to
touch things, and be in movement.
You also like to take notes, not
necessarily to look at them again,
but because the movement of your
hand across paper helps you keep
the information you are studying.</p>
